# angularcomponents1.5
This project is done using AngularJS 1.5 component architect model.

In this project I am not using two way databinding with the component so the scope of the components are not required to watch their scope values.

Instead making use of component life cycle hooks to detect the changes in the scope values.

For unit testing , I am using karma with jasmine. You can able to see the karma.conf.js file inside the root directory.

I am using bower and npm package manager with this project source.
